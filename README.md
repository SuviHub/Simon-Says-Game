# Simon Says Game
## Objective
The goal of the Simon Says game is to test and improve memory and concentration skills. The game presents a random sequence of colors (each associated with a button) that the player must repeat in the same order. With each successful repetition, the sequence grows longer, increasing the difficulty. The player continues until they make an incorrect move, at which point their score, representing the highest level reached, is displayed. The player can restart the game by pressing any key.


Used HTML,CSS and javaScript to develop it.
